=============

PickMeUp is a sample ride sharing application that accompanies IBM Redbooks Publication SG24-8228-00: Building Realtime Mobile Solutions with MQTT and IBM Message Sight (http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/Redbooks.nsf/RedpieceAbstracts/sg248228.html)

The application is powered by MQTT and IBM MessageSight.

This project includes three different applications:
